# Magitnup's Dance School

### My first go at coding.
### I wanted to create a website which displays simple information about a (fictional) dance school.

+ I only used basic of html and css
+ started with navigations
+ because I couldn't see through the line of code well, I started giving some text paragraphs to the different files
+ registration -> form
+ Schedule -> table (happy I remembered to use on empty <th> element!! :D)
+ Events & Performances -> unordered list

+ the navigation didn't work, after trying out some changes I found out, that I had to remove the "pages/" from every other page than index and add an "../" to get back to index.
+ added a google maps in contacts: website used -> https://www.maps.ie/create-google-map/

# Magitnup's Dance School

### my first go at coding
### I wanted to creat a website which is simple and displays information to the (fictional) dance school
### furthermore I only used the bare basics of html and css

+ I started with navigations
+ because I couldn't see through the line of code well, I started giving some text paragraphs to the different files
+ registration -> form
+ Schedule -> table (happy I remembered to use on empty <th> element!! :D)
+ Events & Performances -> unordered list

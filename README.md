"Home to motivated dancers and a wonderful place to connect with likeminded individuals."

+ The landing page image:
    + The image shows an AI generated woman dancing in front of two ginormous hands that try to hold/catch her. It perfectly depicts our struggle against certain standards of society.

+ Home:
    + Other than the landing page image, it also got a smaller menu with pictures, again linked to the 'Schedule', 'Registration', 'Events & Performances' and 'The Team' pages.

### Goals:
+ The website should be easy to understand and navigate
+ focus on using html and css
+ no visual clutter

### Testing:

+ Banner-Picture:
    + Depending on Laptop/PC or mobile screen:<br>
    The landing page image, as well as all the other images of that size will not be shown on smaller devices. That way the information won't be covered/overwhelmed by visual clutter.
+ Schedule:
    + Depending on Laptop/PC or mobile screen the data will be displayed differently.

+ To get an appealing look there was a lot of testing with 'margin' and 'padding'
+ Tried adding an audio element, but couldn't make it stick without an error report.
    + Didn't want to leave the bug, so I removed the audio of 'Vienna Blood' a beautyful Viennese Waltz...
